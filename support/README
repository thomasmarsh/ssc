SUPPORT PACKAGS FOR SSC
-----------------------

SSC needs a few packages to be compiled. For source distributions we include,
for example, a stripped down version of ODE (no drawstuff or test
directories).

If you are building from CVS you will need to get the extra packages and place
them in this directory. Then you will need to look at Makefile.am and make
sure the version information (directory names) correspond to the package you
have just provided.
