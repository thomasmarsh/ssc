For now, look at the README. The simple instructions are:

	./configure
	make
	make install	# as root
	ssc

Currently, SSC looks for the audio files in the "./wav/" directory,
so if you provide the necessary audio files in that directory, or
you received a distribution (i.e., not from CVS), you should have
these sounds.
