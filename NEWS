Version 0.8
-----------

	- ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) is used for all physics modelling now;
	  this gets rid of many TODO items, and paves the way to some
	  other interesting physically-based features (joints, motors, etc.)

	- the game should be O(n) where it was O(n^2) before, so it can
	  handle more objects on screen on slower machines now

	- Asteroids have been added with nice texturization (though collision
	  detection is based on spheres, not the asteroid dimensions)

	- SSC now looks for ssc.conf files in several places

	- there is a simplistic in-game menu system; you still can't configure
	  SSC from there, but that will come later

	- I have played around with neural net learned flying a bit, and will
          implement some better learning objects in the future
          (see smarty.[h/cc]).


In the plans for 0.9:

	- a cleanup of all implemented components

	- scoring system

	- better gameplay, goals, and levels

	- better enemies and enemy AI

	- better graphics


If you have any ideas on how to make the game more fun, let me know. I
have been too busy with all the subsystems to worry about gameplay, so
send me your input!


Version 0.7
-----------

	- using a new coordinate system internally; the game is much
	  more 3D now!

	- added camera views (press 'c' while playing to cycle perspective)

	- more game tuning and speedups

	- added a (temporary) particle effect for acceleration


In the plans for 0.8:

	- Menu system (using customized OGLFT and fonts from DivideByZero)

	- config file (~/.ssc/ssc.conf)

	- scoring system

	- texture mapping/blending for better effects


Version 0.6
-----------

	- added configure/automake scripts

	- ported to Windows (XP/2000)

	- some speedups (fewer stars, etc)

	- some teaks to AI; much more interesting flocking

	- many internal code cleanups


Version 0.5
-----------

	- synchronization enhancements 

	- simplified flocking; it now no longer requires a separate loop over
	  flock members [goes from O(N^2) to O(N)].

	- simple leveling logic added
