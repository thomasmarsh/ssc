General
-------

- Add game modes and menu (Start Game/Select Level/Options).

- Keep track of the score

- Multiplayer and network support

- Better definition of Levels and Goals

- Maybe new starwars scroller intro? How about a story first...

- Better weights should be provided in flock.cc...


Architectural
-------------

- Maybe generalize object grouping so there is an intermediaray class
  ObjectGroup from which Flock would inherit. (Flock is now reference counted,
  so it would mean making some changes again to it's architecture.)

- Add support for conglomerate objects

- Provide a configuration object which has decent defaults and reads
  ~/.ssc/ssc.conf files

- Use a generic event generation mechanism to abstract away from SDL


Graphics
--------

- Objects are pretty simple looking; anyone willing to help to add textures and
  nice special effects?


Physics
-------

- Gravity was taken out of the game in the transition to ODE. I should put it
  back in; probably via the move() method of each object.

- Springs and joints would be a nice addition, allowing interesting behaviours
  for conglomerate objects


IDEAS:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. New Enemies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Mines
=========

Mines react on proximity and have countdown timer to explosion

1.2 Launchers
=============

Launchers are attached to other objects (e.g., to asteroids or walls), and
spawn new objects (ships, missiles, mines, etc..)

1.3 Lunatics
============

Lunatics have negative mass; they don't work in ODE because overlap is not
allowed, so they have to be implemented externally. I believe using joints
is the best approach.

1.4 Black holes
===============

Suck you in. Same problems as 1.3 regarding ODE. At the cost of adding the
following to ScreenObject:

	if (mRespondGravity)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < Gravity::numSources(); ++i)
		{
			static Coord3<double> gravity;

			gravity = Gravity::getGravity(i);

			PhysicsObject::accelerate(gravity.x,
						  gravity.y,
						  gravity.z);
		}
	}

1.5 Worms
=========

Spheres linked in a chain. They could fire or just approach player. Killing
one link in the chain should result in two separate chains.

	void move(double dt)
	{
		// links don't think, just the head
		if (mPrev) return;
		
		// normal accel logic
	}

1.6 Bosses
==========

There should be some big objects with lots of different attacks at, say,
every five levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Power-ups
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There could be serveral power-up types:

	- health (addition & restoration)
	- shield (addition & restoration)
	- time-limited invulnerability
	- 2x shoot rate (10 seconds)
	- hold+charge+release=fire (rtype style firing)

Power-ups should come from big enemies, or be random and rare.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. New Weapons
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- kill-all fireball
	- megablast centered around ship

Weapons could be split into standard missile and bomb types. I imagine bouncey
missiles as currently, and bombs that explode with a big damage radius.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Level goals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Defeat all enemies
======================

The most basic level goal. May be time limited. Can be limited to specific
type of object (e.g., kill all bogies)


4.2 Capture the Flag
====================

Reach a static point. Can also have extended CtF where the player must
reach a series of points in correct order. May be time limited.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Internal Level Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than a bound play area, it would be nice to have corridors and walls
in a more free-form/maze fashion.
