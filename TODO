General
-------

- Add game modes and menu (Start Game/Select Level/Options).

- Keep track of the score

- Multiplayer and network support

- Better definition of Levels and Goals

- Maybe new starwars scroller intro? How about a story first...

- Better weights should be provided in flock.cc...


Architectural
-------------

- Maybe generalize object grouping so there is an intermediaray class
  ObjectGroup from which Flock would inherit. (Flock is now reference counted,
  so it would mean making some changes again to it's architecture.)

- Add support for conglomerate objects

- Provide a configuration object which has decent defaults and reads
  ~/.ssc/ssc.conf files

- Use a generic event generation mechanism to abstract away from SDL


Graphics
--------

- Objects are pretty simple looking; anyone willing to help to add textures and
  nice special effects?


Physics
-------

- Gravity was taken out of the game in the transition to ODE. I should put it
  back in; probably via the move() method of each object.

- Springs and joints would be a nice addition, allowing interesting behaviours
  for conglomerate objects
